Assignment 1: Chapter 4 Haskell road.

List of things that are a bit unclear :
  - Extensionality. It is not really explained and wikipedia defines it as
  "principles that judge properties to be equal if they have the same external
  properties". It is unclear what is meant by external properties.
  - Why is the Num class in Haskell a subclass of Eq and not a subclass of Ord?
    Are there numbers that are not orderable?
  - The proof for why the empty set is in all Sets is unclear to me. I don't
    understand the step:
    "Then ⊥ (contradiction with the fact that ∅ has no members). Therefore x ∈ A."
    Why is it that when we have a contradiction on x ∈ ∅ we can conclude x ∈ A
    for any arbitrary x?
